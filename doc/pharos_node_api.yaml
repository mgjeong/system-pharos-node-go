  description: >-
    This is a description of Pharos Node API which is called by Pharos Anchor.  

    Pharos Node interacts with Pharos Anchor and enables
    distribution and control of microservices on an app-by-app basis.

    In addition, It provides resource information API.
    
    
    Pharos Node's base url should be changed depending on whether Pharos Node is behind a reverse proxy.
